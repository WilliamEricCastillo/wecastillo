# Personal Website - README

Welcome to my personal website repository! This repository showcases the code for my personal website, developed using React and hosted on GitHub Pages. Please note that this README is not intended to guide you on how to run the website locally, but rather to provide you with information about the technologies and features used in this project.

## Project Overview

I have created this personal website to establish an online presence and showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. The website is built using React.

- **React Framework**: The website is developed using React, allowing for efficient component-based development and seamless navigation.
  
- **Material UI Integration**: Material UI components are utilized for elegant card designs, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.

- **Email Form Integration**: The website features an email form powered by Email JS, enabling efficient communication. Visitors can use this form to get in touch with me directly.

- **Responsive Design**: HTML and CSS are used extensively to ensure a responsive layout. The website adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across platforms.

- **Google Analytics Integration**: Google Analytics has been implemented to track user visits and interactions on the website. This helps in understanding user behavior and improving the website's content and usability.
